This is epoxyinfo, a not-entirely-frivolous port of glxinfo to epoxy.

epoxyinfo was inspired as the easiest way to answer the question: "what
GL configuration does an epoxy-using application see?" In this sense
epoxyinfo tests just how transparent one's epoxy is. This is not a trivial
question! epoxy's bootstrap code is subtle, and has to be very careful to
avoid disrupting the existing GL state of the application, so epoxyinfo
can be useful to find (or provoke) bugs in epoxy itself.

Future directions:

- clean up the code to be more idiomatically epoxy
- optionally use EGL/WGL/...
- your feature here

Every effort will be made to retain a mode of operation that is output-
compatible with glxinfo (specifically the version from mesa-demos), as
that's the whole point.
